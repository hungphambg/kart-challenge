# Story 6.4: Ensure API documentation

**Epic:** Deployment & Documentation

**Description:**
As a developer, I want to ensure that the API documentation, based on the provided OpenAPI specification, is accessible and up-to-date, so that consumers of the API can easily understand how to interact with it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `openapi.yaml` file (`api/openapi.yaml`) is kept up-to-date with the implemented API endpoints.
- Instructions are provided in the `README.md` (or a dedicated `docs` section) on how to view the interactive API documentation (e.g., using Swagger UI or Redoc).
- The documentation accurately reflects the implemented endpoints, request/response formats, and error structures.
