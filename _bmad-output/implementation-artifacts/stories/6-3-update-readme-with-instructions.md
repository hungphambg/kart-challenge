# Story 6.3: Update README with instructions

**Epic:** Deployment & Documentation

**Description:**
As a developer, I want to update the `README.md` file with clear instructions on how to set up, build, run, and test the application, so that other developers (and reviewers) can easily get started with the project.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `README.md` file in the project root is updated.
- It includes a "Getting Started" section with prerequisites (Go, Docker).
- It provides instructions on how to use `docker-compose` to start the API and database.
- It provides instructions on how to run database migrations.
- It explains how to build and run the Go application directly (without Docker, for development convenience).
- It details how to run any implemented tests.
- It includes a brief overview of the API endpoints and how to interact with them.
